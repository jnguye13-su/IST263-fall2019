        <p>Swim meets consist of around 16 events involving four different strokes for a range distances. Some events are relays with you and three other teammates and the other races are purely individual. The amount of days that the competitions last depends on the level that you are swimming at, but the olympics and olympic trials usually last around 8 days consisting of Heats, Semifinals, final, and timed final. Ultimately you goals is to make it to the last day and compete in the finals in order to make the olympic team or get top three to medal at the olympics.</p>

        <img src="images/Qualifying.jpg" alt="Competition swimming"/>
        <p>Qualifying for the Olympics is extremely difficult let alone medaling at the Olympics. Before you go to the Olympics you have to qualify for the trials first. In order to qualify for the trials you have to meet all the time cuts and standards which is also very difficult. Once qualified for trials you have to get past the heats and semi-finals in order to be the top 8 swimmers in that event in the finals. Once in the finals you have to compete against the top 8 fastets people in your country to fight for the first and second place spot in order to qualify for your Olympic team. The same process happens at the Olympics but this time you are going against the whole world to fight for the top 3 spots in order to medal.</p>
