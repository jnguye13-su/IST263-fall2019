<p> My project idea will be about the hard work and dedication that Olympic swimmers put into their practices in order to  make the Olympic team in an individual event or a relay.</p>
<p> I am going to go over the number of swimmers that make the Olympic team every four years. I will also be going over what kind of drills and swim sets that competitive swimmers work on everyday in order to train their bodies to become stronger and faster.</p>
<p>I will be getting my content from livestrong.com, swimswam.com, and sportingnews.com</p>
